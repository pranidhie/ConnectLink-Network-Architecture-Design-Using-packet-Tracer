# ConnectLink-Network-Architecture-Design-Using-packet-Tracer

üñß Connect Link Network Design Project
üìç Introduction
Connect Link operates across a three-floor office building, with each floor dedicated to a specific department. To support efficient daily operations, the company needs a reliable, secure, and scalable network design. This project outlines the planning, design, and simulation of such a network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Each floor is equipped with its own switch and hosts unique sets of users. The network is segmented using VLANs, interlinked using routers, and includes DHCP services, port security, and remote access to ensure smooth and secure communication.

üéØ Project Objectives
The main goals of the project are:

Segmented Network: Each department has its own VLAN to separate traffic and reduce broadcast domains.

Inter-VLAN Routing: Communication between departments is enabled through a router-on-a-stick setup while maintaining security boundaries.

Centralized IP Management: IP addresses are dynamically assigned using DHCP pools to reduce manual configuration errors.

Secure Remote Access: Router management is enabled through SSH, offering encrypted access to authorized admins.

Access Control: Unauthorized devices are blocked using port security.

Hierarchical Modular Design: The network is designed in layers (access, distribution, core) to support better organization and future scalability.

üß≠ Scenario Overview
The building has 3 floors, each assigned to a different department:

Floor 1: Admin Department

Floor 2: IT Department

Floor 3: Finance Department

Each floor is connected via its own Layer 2 switch.

All switches are connected to a central router that manages VLAN routing and external connections.

Static routes and OSPF (if applicable) are configured for proper network reachability.
